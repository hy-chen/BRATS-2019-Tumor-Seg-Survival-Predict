the dataset: open nii.gz by mricon

histogram equalization
 - two types: regular, contrast limited adaptive
 - available in cv2 or scikit

0-1/min-max normalization vs. mean normalization. 

visualize the different MRI method images through historgram to see their data consistency. 

survival ( days from identified to death)

prediction of survival from the data

team: make sure we use the same training and validation set, make sure the seed is the same

train data - cross validation - k-fold -> determines the portion of validation( e.g. k = 5 then 1/5 is validation) 

input: hgg/lgg, age, images. output: survival days. 

linear regression 

or starting from the binary classification. (divide the survival to two class. 

momentum = 0.9 
adaptive drop_out 0.5  

— "Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014."
Dropout is not used in inference. 


hypothesis: one MRI is too large when feed 240*240*155*5 per patient. usually images: 56*56*3 per image. 
MRI is too sparse. use max from the image. area and location may be important too. but location is not taken for CNN. 

we can have the CNN and output like 10 features then combine with ages, hgg/lgg binary, then ...

we use the segmentation data together with the other MRIs.

tools/models: linear regression, CNN, RNN, GAN, transfer learning, Adam, CrossEntropy, MSE.

we are only doing it for the training data right now. not too consistent with the given test set. 

-> how to integrate the spatial information 

tip: visualize the weights. to debug.
