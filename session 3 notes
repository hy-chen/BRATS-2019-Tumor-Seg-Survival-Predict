Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis

- Medical images
    varies dramatically by image type
    different noise patterns, patient motion, disease, many modalities
    can be very big and obvious (tumor) or small and subtle (neurodegeneration)
    a lot of 3+ dimensions so voxel instead of pixel. 
- segmentation
- registration


Tools: 
 probabilities, convolutions, anatomical models, and clinical interpretation
Challenge: 
 "the system don't really work yet"
 
 
 Medical Image Analysis
(or: how can we help?)
• Diagnosis algorithms - require large datasets
• Visualization - learn what to show, widely overlooked?
• Segmentation - outline, measure anatomy and pathology
• Registration - alignment for treatment planning, population analysis
• Acquisition - faster, better
• Abnormality detection - pathology
• Shape modelling
• Joint inference with other clinical data
