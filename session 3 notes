Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis

- Medical images
    varies dramatically by image type
    different noise patterns, patient motion, disease, many modalities
    can be very big and obvious (tumor) or small and subtle (neurodegeneration)
    a lot of 3+ dimensions so voxel instead of pixel. 
- segmentation
    VGG: images -> labels 
    Fully convolutional: (embedding) both input and output is high-dimensional
    U-net: The network is based on the fully convolutional network and its architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentations. Segmentation of a 512*512 image takes less than a second on a modern GPU. U-net deals with 2D images. Input: image. Output: 0 and 1 across the image to indicate the mask of "attention" area. (e.g. tumor) 
    V-net: deals with 3D images. not repeating U-net for each slide... instead it does 3D convolutions. have a different structure.
    *use V-net* :)
    
    
- registration


Tools: 
 probabilities, convolutions, anatomical models, and clinical interpretation
Challenge: 
 "the system don't really work yet"
 
 
 Medical Image Analysis
(or: how can we help?)
• Diagnosis algorithms - require large datasets
• Visualization - learn what to show, widely overlooked?
• Segmentation - outline, measure anatomy and pathology
• Registration - alignment for treatment planning, population analysis
• Acquisition - faster, better
• Abnormality detection - pathology
• Shape modelling
• Joint inference with other clinical data
